Creating Text Games with my Daughter
Learning Haskell

I shamelessly copied David Matuszek's code at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cis554-2016/Pages/CSS%20554%20Haskell%20Adventure.html

# How to launch a story (game) ?
```runhaskell story1.hs```

Weird sounds come out of the cave nearby. A cave which is completely forbidden to access. Until now...
